# hello-world
## A project to learn about github
### I need to write a little bit about myself. 
* It's very sad how I came here only today. 
* But maybe it's not too late. 
* Better start later than never start, right? 
* Wherever I fall, wherever I stand up again.
* I need to work hard to acheive my goals and dreams. 
* Take a little bit action every day.
